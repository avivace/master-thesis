\chapter{Modernising Rate Monitoring Tools}

One of the major challenges for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, is the task of reducing event rate from roughly 40 MHz down to a more manageable 1 kHz while keeping as many interesting physics events as possible. This is accomplished through the use of a Level-1 (L1) hardware based trigger as well as a software based High-Level Trigger (HLT). Monitoring and understanding the output rates of the L1 and HLT triggers is of key importance for determining the overall performance of the trigger system and is intimately tied to what type of data is being recorded for physics analyses.

Here, we introduce the Trigger System in operation at the CMS experiment and proceed giving an overview of the software development work done to improve and add new features to the CMS Rate Monitoring software, a collection of tools used by CMS shifters to monitor the L1 and HLT trigger rates. Some additional experimental components have ben developed to showcase possible upgrades, delivering quality of life enhancements and enabling shifters and physicists to navigate data in a faster and more comfortable way.

Finally, proper export functionalities have been added to the tools, allowing to save and export Trigger Rates as JSON or ROOT binary files.

This work is also described in \cite{VivaceRTM1} \cite{VivaceRTM2} \cite{L1TriggerOMSDevelopments} \cite{MohrmanRTM}, the source code is available in the RateMon git repository \cite{RateMonGit}.

\section{CMS Trigger System}

A Trigger is an  electronic system for spotting potentially interesting collisions in a particle detector and triggering the detector’s read-out system to record the data resulting from the collision.

The LHC generates 40 millions events per second. Each event recorded by the CMS detector, carries on average a payload of 1 MB of unprocessed informations. It is technologically impossible to retain this amount of data, due to hardware, software, network and storage constraints. Furthermore, most events represent uninteresting information for the current state of physics knowledge.

The \textit{CMS Trigger System} is designed to reduce the output stream to 1000 events per second, while preserving the physics reach of the experiment.
It is composed by a hierarchical set of rules, called Trigger Nodes (or Paths): each one probes a specific patterns (physics signature) in the event or looks for specific physics objects.

This happens in two steps:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The first level (L1) \cite{Bayatyan:706847} brings the 40 MHz to a 100 kHz rate. Here, N Trigger Algorithms are implemented on custom electronics (FPGAs and ASICs) exploiting informations from sub-detector components.

    \item A configurable set of L1 Trigger Nodes seeds Triggers in the second level (HLT), implemented in software. The event stream is further refined, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage and certification \cite{Khachatryan_2017}. HLT runs 600 of these independent Trigger Paths.

\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\section{Rate Monitoring software}

\subsection{Shift Monitor tool}

The High Level Trigger (HLT) rate monitoring tool is a python script that reports the rates of a selected list of triggers, primary datasets, and streams. It is run in the CMS control room and gives valuable real-time feedback of trigger rates to the shift crew: it updates every minute and averages the rates recorded in the last 3 lumisections, and, if possible, compares them to the predicted rate. Predictions are based on functions previously fitted on the same Trigger (\textit{fit functions}).

If a trigger path deviates by a specified amount from the prediction, or exceeds a fixed rate, the corresponding line is highlighted in a yellow colour. The scripts also displays other information that could be useful for the shifter, such as the run number and last lumisections, the LHC status, HLT key, deadtime, instantaneous luminosity and index of the prescale column in use.

\begin{figure}
    \centerline{
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\paperwidth]{figures/ratemon_warnings}}
    \caption{Example execution of the Rate Monitoring Tool showing warnings: two triggers have values consistently deviating from the predictions. \cite{ratemon-twiki}}
    \label{fig:ratemon_warnings}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Trigger Rate plotting}

Another part of the software offers plotting features, exposed with \texttt{plotTriggerRates} command line tool: it is used for observing how trigger rates vary over a range of beam and detector conditions, in particular how the rates of individual triggers scale with event pile-up.

Trigger Rates are usually represented in \textit{Rate vs. PileUp} plots, specifically "pre-deadtime unprescaled rate / num colliding bx [Hz]" over "PU" (Pile Up luminosity) units, generated by the RateMon tools.

In general, \textit{deadtime} refers to a time period during normal data taking when collisions are occurring but CMS is not ready to record the the data. This can occur for various reasons that are described in section 6.2.1 of \cite{Khachatryan_2017}. "pre-deadtime" rates are used in plots to allow for consistent comparison between different runs/fills; different runs and fills could have had different deadtimes, so correcting the rates for deadtime before fitting will allow the rates from different runs to be compared in a consistent way.

A \textit{prescale} is a way of scaling back the rate of L1 and HLT triggers. For example, if a certain trigger has a prescale of 5, then the data corresponding to the event the trigger fired on is only recorded once out of every five times that the trigger fired. So if the prescale is 1, the data will be recorded every time the trigger fires. A prescale of 0 actually means that no data will be recorded for the trigger in question; the trigger is essentially just turned off. Again, correcting for deadtime in Rate VS PU plots is to allow for consistent comparisons of rates for different runs/fills and across pre scale columns. 

\subsection{Overview}

A series of improvements and new features have been implemented on the Rate Monitoring tools, achieving the following goals:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Upgraded the tools to run on a recent and supported version of Python;
\item Moved the database connection configuration class to an actual configuration file;
\item Formally defined the environment and the dependencies needed to run the software;
\item Prepared scripts to package the software with the RPM package format. Prepared a basic systemd service to include in the package, to allow running the software as a system service;
\item Prepared a Continuos Integration and Deployment pipeline running on the CERN infrastructure;
\item Upgraded the CI/CD pipeline to use the CMS Cactus auto DevOps tools;
\item Upgraded the exporting feature of the tools, currently limited to screen output and small PNG image renders;
\item Enabled the tools to export trigger data in a agnostic format, not tied to ROOT;
\item Enabled the tools to export trigger data in ROOT files, allowing ROOT clients to read them;
\item Updated the documentation adding a a way to consistently prepare P5, LXPLUS and personal machines to run RateMon tools, without being tied to a particular machine cluster at CERN;
\item Enabled any user to import the RateMon software as a Python module, adding some external and transparent methods to get Trigger Rates;
\item Investigated a solution to integrate RateMon into the new CMS Online Monitoring System, replacing the old Web Based Monitoring, now in deprecation.
\item Since a proper integration was not possible, implemented an API exposing the exporting, processing and plotting functionalities of the RateMon software. This API is formally defined with an OpenAPI 3 Schema and an autogenerated Swagger interface is available to users;
\item Implemented a web application to demonstrate and showcase the API capabilities, plotting Trigger Rates in the browser with interactive and scalable plots (powered by JSROOT) instead of static image exports, consuming the new API;
\item Implemented a Trigger Selection interface on the UI, a feature requested by Trigger shifters and coordinators.
\item Reported a series of bugs happening in the data processing phase of the scripts, detailing scenarios triggering them, to allow future work on them.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Infrastructure and tools}

We quickly introduce some tools and services we will be mentioning later, outlining their scopes in these operations:

\paragraph{GitLab}

GitLab is a DevOps lyfecycle tool, providing Git hosting, a wiki, issue-tracking, contrinuos integration and deployment features. There's a public instance running at GitLab.com, but the software is licensed with an "open-core" business model, so everyone can self-host the entire stack, provided they have the infrastructure.

GitLab business model is defined as "open core" (and not "open source"). They offer the core functionalities as free and open source software, while additional commercial features are offered in the paid plans, developed in a closed-source modality.

In 2017, CERN chose GitLab as their code hosting solution and moved to a self-hosted GitLab instance. From now on, with "GitLab" we will refer to the CERN GitLab instance.

\paragraph{Docker}

Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, mostly isolated from the host machine.

We use Docker to prepare isolated and reproducible environments in which we can run the building, packaging and deployment phases of the DevOps pipeline.

Docker containers are defined by a single file, called Dockerfile.

TODO: container registry?

\paragraph{EOS}

EOS \cite{Peters_2015} is an open source distributed low-latency disk storage system in production since 2011 at CERN. Having a highly-scalable hierarchical namespace, and with data access possible by the XROOT protocol, it was initially used for physics data storage. Today, EOS provides storage for both physics and user use cases.

\paragraph{CERNBox}

CERNBox \cite{Mascetti_2015} is the cloud data storage service available to all CERN users. It provides a synchronisation and sharing clients for end users on all major platforms, including a web servioe. Core of the implementation is the XRootD framework providing a feature-rich remote access protocol.  It is powered by the CERN EOS infrastructure as its storage backend.

\paragraph{WBM} The CMS Web Based Monitoring \cite{badgett2014web}

\paragraph{OMS} The CMS Online Monitoring System \cite{Andre2649402} 

\paragraph{ROOT} ROOT \cite{Brun:1997pa} 


\section{Packaging, CI/CD}

The CMS Rate Monitoring git repository was hosted on GitHub. To enable Continues Integration and Continuos Deployment features, we migrated the repository to the CERN GitLab. The repository on GitHub is being kept as a mirror (as an additional git remote target) but the pipelines will be handled by GitLab.


\begin{listing}[ht]
\begin{yamlcode}

# EOS_PATH can be defined here or, if it needs to be hidden, 
# as a secure variable of the project (Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables)
# Note that the deploy-eos script needs the EOS_ACCOUNT_USERNAME and 
# EOS_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD of a secondary CERN account having write access on the
# specified EOS folder. Those are set as project variables.

\end{listing}

The folder has been restructured: the "misc" sub folder now contains the fits logs and the wbmRateReader scripts. Everything else went to a "ratemon" sub folder, which will be the only one being packaged.

We prepared and included a systemd service file, allowing the \texttt{ShiftMonitorTool} to be installed and used as a systemd service.

Each commit triggers a build and a deployment of a RPM package. This CI/CD system is configured in these files:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{.GitLab-ci.yml} describes the GitLab CI. The first phase (\texttt{build\_rpm}) tells the builder (described by \texttt{builder.dockerfile} and exposed on the GitLab registry) to run \texttt{make rpm} (described in \texttt{Makefile}) and flags the RPM package files as artifacts; In the second phase (deploy), those artifacts are pushed on a EOS folder using the ci-web-deployer tool;
    \item \texttt{builder.dockerfile} prepares the docker container that will run the build, starting from the cern/cc7-base image. This is exposed using the GitLab registry feature as \texttt{gitlab-registry.cern.ch/avivace/ratemon/builder};
    \item \texttt{Makefile} Uses the fpm tool to produce an RPM file with the given metadata and contents. Basically, the ratemon script folder is copied into /opt/ and the systemd service file goes into /usr/lib/systemd/system
    \item The build produces an RPM package file. Those files are pushed during the "deploy" CI phase and finally published on a public CERNBox folder (EOS: \texttt{/eos/users/a/avivace/ratemon\_builds}). This is done using a service CERN account.
\end{enumerate}

Previously, the RateMon tools had to be installed checking out the code from the git repository, running a preparatory script, configuring the database connection and then running the script. Now, the system package manager can install the packaged software:

\begin{textcode}
P5 $ rpm -i ratemon_0.1.rpm
\end{textcode}

\subsection{CMS Cactus}

CMS Cactus auto devops \cite{DirkxCactus} is a collection of GitLab CI templates and images designed to ease development and maintenance of CI workflows for Cactus projects. It is built on the same foundations as GitLab AutoDevOps, but tailored for CERN and CMS infrastructure.

We moved the CI/CD and packaging pipeline from vanilla’s GitLab tools to CMS Cactus, now using (and customising) a template provided by this tool.

\section{Configuration}

YAML, schema, database errors?

The ShiftMonitorTool and plotTriggerRates scripts now require an \texttt{--dbConfigFile} option, specifying the YAML configuration file containing the database connection parameters.

I've updated the README and the twiki page to reflect the changes on the DB configuration. Scripts now need to be called in this way:

\begin{textcode}
$ python plotTriggerRates.py --dbConfigFile=dbConfig.yaml --useFills --createFit --bestFit --triggerList=TriggerLists/monitorlistCOLLISIONS.list 6303

\section{Deployment}

\subsection{Attaching a volume for caching}

To offer more disk space to the caching mechanism, a new volume has been created through the CERN Openstack infrastructure.

\begin{textcode}
lxplus $ # activate the correct OpenStack project
lxplus $ eval $(ai-rc 'Ratemon')
lxplus $ openstack volume create --description "Volume for RateMon API caching" --type standard --size 600 rtmcachevol
\end{textcode}

Size is measured in GB. The volume type "standard" is the default one, providing a reliable store which is tolerant to at least one disk failure without user impact or data loss. Maximum performance is 80 MB/s and 100 IO operations (both, read and write).

The command \texttt{openstack volume show} should now list the volume as available. We can attach it to the VM serving the API (\texttt{ater})

\begin{textcode}
lxplus $ openstack server add volume ater rtmcachevol
\end{textcode}

On the \texttt{ater} machine, \texttt{fdisk -l} will give the disks overview, listing the new volume. I noted the device ID (\texttt{/dev/vdb}) and then executed \texttt{fdisk /dev/vdb} to launch fdisk, the partition manager tool provided by the util-linux standard package.

\begin{textcode}
ater $ fdisk -l
...
Disk /dev/vdb: 600 GiB, 644245094400 bytes, 1258291200 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
\end{textcode}

In the fdisk shell, create a new partition (\texttt{n}), select is a primary (\texttt{p}) and denote it as the first (\texttt{1}). Set it to occupy all the available space accepting defaults. Select again the partition (\texttt{t}) and set the Linux partition type (\texttt{83}). (\texttt{p}) displays the partition setup we just defined. If that's okay, (\texttt{w}) commits the modifications and applies them.

\begin{textcode}
Device     Boot Start        End    Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/vdb1        2048 1258291199 1258289152  600G 83 Linux
\end{textcode}

Back in the standard shell, use \texttt{mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb} to format the partition using the EXT4 file system.

Note the UUID of our newly formatted partition:

\begin{textcode}
ater $ mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb
mke2fs 1.45.4 (23-Sep-2019)
Creating filesystem with 157286400 4k blocks and 39321600 inodes
Filesystem UUID: f74a87c8-7ced-4414-bc62-e09d07be7845
\end{textcode}

Now that we know the UUID, we can mount the volume:

\begin{textcode}
ater $ mkdir /cache
ater $ mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/f74a87c8-7ced-4414-bc62-e09d07be7845 /cache
\end{textcode}

To make the mounting persistent, we add this entry to the \texttt{/etc/fstab} file:

\begin{textcode}
UUID=f74a87c8-7ced-4414-bc62-e09d07be7845   /cache  auto defaults,nofail    0 3
\end{textcode}

Here's the final situation, as described by \texttt{df -h}:

\begin{textcode}
ater $ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
...
/dev/vda2        40G   33G  7.6G  82% /
/dev/vdb        590G   73M  560G   1% /cache
\end{textcode}
