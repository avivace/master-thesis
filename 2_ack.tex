I would like to express my appreciation to Simone Gennai, Fabio Stella and Glenn Dirkx, for giving me the chance to work on a project of this magnitude, joining a community of passionate researchers.

Furthermore, they gave me the freedom, the tools and the motivations to investigate my ideas, while also being critical and providing invaluable feedback.

I extend my gratitude to everyone at CERN who gave me useful advices and precious insights: Dinyar Rabady, Anna Ferrari, Andrea Bocci, Fabio Espinosa, Alessandro Thea, Sam James Harper, Pietro Govoni.

Thanks to CERN and the CMS collaboration for the datasets and the computing resources used in this work.

At my home university, I would like to mention Leonardo Mariani, Daniela Micucci, Edoardo Datteri and Roberto Previtera. I also thank the students I supervised, Riccardo, Alessandro, Morris, Luca and Stefano from whom I learned a lot.

Last, but not least, I send my love to the inspiring and brilliant teachers I had during my earlier education: Camilla D'Andria, Caterina Brasacchio, Maurizia Perego, Luca Mauri.
