\begin{abstract}

I would like to express my appreciation to Simone Gennai, Fabio Stella and Glenn Dirkx, for giving me the chance to work on something incredible with incredible people.

Furthermore, they gave me the freedom, the tools and the motivations to investigate my ideas, while also being critical and providing invaluable feedback.

I extend my gratitude to everyone at CERN that gave me useful advices and precious insights: Dinyar Rabady, Anna Ferrari, Andrea Bocci, Fabio Espinosa, Alessandro Thea, Sam James Harper, Pietro Govoni.

At my home university, I'd like to thank Leonardo Mariani, Daniela Micucci, Edoardo Datteri and Roberto Previtera. I thank the students I supervised, Riccardo, Alessandro, Luca, Stefano from whom I learned a lot.

Last, but not least, I send my love to the earlier teachers I had the luck to have: Camilla D'Andria, Caterina, Maurizia Perego, Luca Mauri.
