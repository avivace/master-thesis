@article{Wightman2019,
	abstract = {One of the major challenges for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)experiment, is the task of reducing event rate from roughly 40 MHz down to a more manageable 1 kHz while keeping as many interesting physics events as possible. This is accomplished through the use of a Level-1 (L1) hardware based trigger as well as a software based High-Level Trigger (HLT). Monitoring and understanding the output rates of the L1 and HLT triggers is of key importance for determining the overall performance of the trigger system and is intimately tied to what type of data is being recorded for physics analyses. We present here a collection of tools used by CMS to monitor the L1 and HLT trigger rates. One of these tools is a script (run in the CMS control room) that gives valuable real-time feedback of trigger rates to the shift crew. Another useful tool is a plotting library, that is used for observing how trigger rates vary over a range of beam and detector conditions, in particular how the rates of individual triggers scale with event pile-up.},

SketchUp provides a Ruby API which we use to interface with the CMS Detector Description to create 3D models of the CMS detector. With the Ruby API, we also have created an interface to the JSON-based event format used for the iSpy event display to create 3D models of CMS events. These models have many applications related to 3D representation of the CMS detector and events. Figures produced based on these models were used in conference presentations, journal publications, technical design reports for the detector upgrades, art projects, outreach programs, and other presentations.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

The successful beta phase of the service confirmed the high demand in the community for an easily accessible cloud storage solution such as CERNBox. Integration of the CERNBox service with the EOS storage back-end is the next step towards providing “sync and share” capabilities for scientific and engineering use-cases. In this report we will present lessons learnt in offering the CERNBox service, key technical aspects of CERNBox/EOS integration and new, emerging usage possibilities. The latter includes the ongoing integration of “sync and share” capabilities with the LHC data analysis tools and transfer services.}

		abstract = {EOS is an open source distributed disk storage system in production since 2011 at CERN. Development focus has been on low-latency analysis use cases for LHC1 and non- LHC experiments and life-cycle management using JBOD2 hardware for multi PB storage installations. The EOS design implies a split of hot and cold storage and introduced a change of the traditional HSM3 functionality based workflows at CERN.

				The 2015 deployment brings storage at CERN to a new scale and foresees to breach 100 PB of disk storage in a distributed environment using tens of thousands of (heterogeneous) hard drives. EOS has brought to CERN major improvements compared to past storage solutions by allowing quick changes in the quality of service of the storage pools. This allows the data centre to quickly meet the changing performance and reliability requirements of the LHC experiments with minimal data movements and dynamic reconfiguration. For example, the software stack has met the specific needs of the dual computing centre set-up required by CERN and allowed the fast design of new workflows accommodating the separation of long-term tape archive and disk storage required for the LHC Run II.

				This paper will give a high-level state of the art overview of EOS with respect to Run II, introduce new tools and use cases and set the roadmap for the next storage solutions to come.}
