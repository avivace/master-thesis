\chapter{Anomaly Detection}

In data mining, \textit{Anomaly Detection} is the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior \cite{chandola2009anomaly}. These patterns often denote an underlying different process: an anomaly can be defined an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism \cite{hawkins1980identification}.

This task finds extensive use in many domains, such as fraud detection for credit cards, insurance or health care, intrusion detection for cyber security, military surveillance and fault detection in critical systems.

Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, deviations, exceptions or noise. \textit{Noise removal} and \textit{noise accomodation} are related problems, dealing with the removal of unwanted objects before performing data analysis (removal) and immunizing a statistical model against anomalous observations (accomodation).
