\chapter{Anomaly Detection}

In data mining, \textit{Anomaly Detection} is the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior \cite{chandola2009anomaly}. These patterns often denote an underlying different process: an anomaly can be defined an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism \cite{hawkins1980identification}.

Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.
